      Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
      wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
      provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
      habitat for a great number of migratory and resident specie.

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      Why do you deny potential clients and refuse to sell tickets for your
      events to everyone?

      Our events have prerequisites and requirements and not everyone will make

      of exclusivity and only people with similar values will be placed together
      in each event.

      clean outfit that is a true representation of your personality.

      Absolutely! If it brings you peace of mind to bring along a parent,
      sibling or friend, by all means, do so. Bear in mind though, that anyone
      who is not going to partake in the meet and greet will be seated in a
      separate area to protect the privacy of our users.

      selection such as privacy, security, location and accessibility. All our
      events happen in private party rooms in high-end hotels and restaurants.
