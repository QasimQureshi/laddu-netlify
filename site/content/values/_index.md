      1: Sign up on our website and create a basic profile.  

      2: Our matchmakers will get in touch with you, do an intake interview and
      process payments.  

      3: Based on your responses our algorithm will match you with suitable
      singles who display similar values.  

      4: We will send you an event invite 2 weeks in advance where you will be
      able to meet said suitors

    text: >-
      For starters, we are the antidote to misogynistic Rishta aunties who ask
      regressive questions and shame both men and women. Unlike traditional
      matchmaking firms, we are a transparent company and have no gimmicks. We
      do not solicit outrageous sums of money on pretentious claims, we do not
      have scary contracts and most importantly we create a safe space for our
      clients to meet several suitable suitors in a short time span. You will
      not have to entertain people in your drawing room and endure an additional
      cost of hosting, and then suffer the humiliation of waiting endlessly. Our
      process returns power to our clients, is efficient, and is far less
      expensive way than traditional matchmaking.

  - heading: What is the format of the Laddu event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_sequence_121702.svg
    text: >-
      1) Users will sign in, be given resources for note-taking, a name badge
      and be invited for refreshments.


      2) Orientation: once everyone has arrived, Laddu hosts will explain how
      the event and matchmaking will work.


      3) Rishta-dates: At the event, men and women are rotated to meet each
      other over a series of short " rishta dates" that last six minutes each.
      The women will remain seated while the men will move onto the next table
      when the bell rings. Conversational cue cards will be provided on each
      table to facilitate your interaction.


      4) Scorecard: After each interaction, you should keep notes about the
      person you just met. At the end of the evening, you take home the pamphlet
      with your notes, and go to our website to enter who your favourite suitors
      were.


      5) Matches: If both participants like one another, it is a match. We will
      get in touch with you and set up the next solo meeting between you and
      your match(es). 


      6) Contact information cannot be traded during the initial meeting, in
      order to reduce pressure to accept or reject a suitor to his or her face.

  - heading: How many people will I meet at an event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_people_1711210.svg
    text: >
      There are normally 40 people per event, 20 men and 20 women; but sometimes
      due to unforeseen circumstances, a user may cancel last minute. We highly
      discourage cancellations.

  - heading: Why do you provide conversational cue cards
    imageUrl: /img/noun_Card_1626060.svg
    text: >
      Introducing yourself over and over again to twenty people can quickly
      become very redundant and cumbersome. To capacitate engaging conversation
      we recommend using our conversational cue cards that are based on research
      conducted by psychologists, anthropologists and neuroscientists who study
      human behaviour and intimacy. The cards are built in such a way that they
      draw out even the most introverted people from their shell and allow you
      to learn about your suitor’s values fairly quickly.

  - heading: What type of people will I meet at the event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_Diversity_52927.svg
    text: >-
      We work very hard to maintain the quality of the crowd and filter out any
      bad apples. Most of our clients are professionals who are seriously
      looking to settle down.

  - heading: Are 6 minutes per “rishta date” long enough?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_clock_2326370.svg
    text: >-
      They are long enough for you to get a feel for the other person but short
      enough to endure if the person isn’t your cup of tea.

      Why do you deny potential clients and refuse to sell tickets for your
      events to everyone?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_Stop_2636750.svg
    text: >-
      Our events have prerequisites and requirements and not everyone will make
      the cut. For the overall group experience to be positive, there is an air
      of exclusivity and only people with similar values will be placed together
      in each event.

  - heading: How should I dress for a Laddu event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_suit_2388838.svg
    text: >-
      Wear whatever makes you feel confident and comfortable. While there is no
      official dress code we recommend business casual attire. Aim for a sharp,
      clean outfit that is a true representation of your personality. Ladies, in
      particular, ask us if they should come only in traditional attire- that is
      entirely your call.

  - heading: Can my best friend tag along with me to the event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_celebrity_125787.svg
    text: >-
      For first time users, we highly recommend coming in pairs, it helps the
      nerves. If you are both single and want to be placed in the same event
      please let us know in the intake call. We provide a 10% discount for
      bundle packages.

  - heading: Can a guardian accompany me to the event?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_parent_1375551.svg
    text: >-
      Absolutely! If it brings you peace of mind to bring along a parent,
      sibling or friend, by all means, do so. Bear in mind though, that anyone
      who is not going to partake in the meet and greet will be seated in a
      separate area to protect the privacy of our users.

  - heading: Where do Laddu events happen?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_Hotel_1845946.svg
    text: >-
      Laddu events happen at various venues in multiple cities. There are no
      fixed locations per se, but we consider key features for each venue
      selection such as privacy, security, location and accessibility. All our
      events happen in private party rooms in high-end hotels and restaurants.

  - heading: Is Laddu in my city?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_city_2488436.svg
    text: >-
      Currently, we do events only in Lahore, Islamabad and Toronto but as we
      scale, we aim to add more cities in our network.

  - heading: What is your policy against harassment?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_sexual-harassment_657576.svg
    text: >-
      Laddu is, in essence, a very feminist brand. We emerged into existence due
      to a lack of safe spaces for marriage-minded Muslim men and women to
      connect. We take bullying and harassment very seriously. Not only will the
      culprit be asked to leave the event, but they will also be barred from
      ever attending any future Laddu events.

      Can I pay you extra to purchase the contact information of someone I did
      not match with?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_privacy_1821548.svg
    text: >
      Repeat after us: No means no. Consent ka nara rozana!


      After each event, our clients share their scorecards. We tally the scores
      and let the users know who their matches are, and facilitate further
      interaction between them. If one client likes another client, but the
      interest isn't mutual, we respect that and will not pass along the contact
      information for any amount of money.

  - heading: What is your cancellation policy?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_cancellation-time_2596939.svg
    text: >-
      Since last-minute cancellations affect the overall user experience for the
      group, we ask for a minimum 72-hour notice and will credit 50% of your
      payment to another event of your choice. Cancellations on the day of the
      event and/or "no-shows" are ineligible for credit, and also marked in our
      system. Repeat "no-shows" are barred from registering a third time.

  - heading: Will you refund my money if I don’t get any matches?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_refund_1238553.svg
    text: >-
      No. Our job is to provide a safe space for eligible single Muslims to meet
      a large number of potential partners with similar values, in a very short
      period of time. We do our best to keep quality singles in the mix, but the
      burden of charming others enough to court you lies on you.

  - heading: Any tips to help me get the most out of my Laddu experience?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_teamwork_654885.svg
    text: >-
      Yes, so glad that you asked! As cliche as it sounds, come with an open
      mind, an open heart, budding optimism and dare we say- even a sense of
      adventure. Instead of focusing on what you don’t like in your potential
      suitor, focus on what you do like. Finding flaws and cracks is easy,
      seeing the beauty in another is hard (and a learned trait). We encourage
      you to keep an open mind, even if the person in front of you isn’t
      traditionally “your type”. The universe opens you up to so many
      possibilities when you let go of rigid standards. Bear in mind, that
      you're meeting a real person, not a genetically engineered manifestation
      of your fantasies. Lastly, be gentle in your interactions. Kindness is
      paramount. Refrain from passing aggressive, aggravating comments and/or
      outright rejections.

  - heading: How much does a Laddu event cost?
    imageUrl: /img/noun_pakistani-coins_2036824.svg
    text: >-
      Our ticket is currently priced at PKR. 5000, which is a steal deal
      considering that the cost of a singular “rishta trolley spread” costs more
      than that. Whereas, unlike the traditional rishta setting, we are
      introducing you to 20 other suitors in that price point. Quite the value
      proposition, if we say so ourselves.
