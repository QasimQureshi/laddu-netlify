  text: >-
    For the Muslim community marriage is a rite of passage into adulthood and
    not a choice. The traditional way of getting married includes an outdated
    matchmaker, often dubbed the Rishta Aunty, ubiquitously renowned for asking
    regressive questions and pigeonholing people in the guise of finding an
    appropriate partner. This approach does not work for millennials and is
    especially derogatory for women who are shamed for having any personality.
    The alternative- dating apps, also don't work for Muslims who are seeking
    marriage and not hookups. 
      
    Laddu aims to take online-dating offline and in doing so, create a
    progressive space for marriage-minded Muslims to meet. Our app enables
    Muslims globally to connect in person and offline through tailored events.
    The app is currently being alpha tested, but event registration is open in
    Lahore.

  heading: How Laddu Events Work
  text: >-
    Our events encourage eligible single Muslims to meet a large number of
    potential partners with similar values, in a very short period of time. Each
    event caters up to 40 people, advance registration is required. Based on
    your values, our algorithm places you in a specific cohort of like-minded
    single Muslims.  
      
    At the event, men and women are rotated to meet each other over a series of
    short " rishta dates" that last six minutes each. At the end of the event,
    participants submit a list of people they enjoyed interacting with and would
    like to get to know more. If both participants liked one another, there is a
    match, and we forward contact information to both parties. Contact
    information cannot be traded during the initial meeting, in order to reduce
    pressure to accept or reject a suitor to his or her face.  
      
    On said date, you're free to hold a conversation on your own but we highly
    recommend using our conversational cue cards that are based on research done
    by psychologists and social scientists that study intimacy. These cards
    enable you to learn about values fairly quickly and create an easy flow of
    conversation.
