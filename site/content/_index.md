  heading: Why Laddu
  text: >-
    For the Muslim community marriage is a rite of passage into adulthood and
    not a choice.

    <br /><br />

    The traditional way of getting married includes an outdated matchmaker,
    often dubbed the Rishta Aunty, ubiquitously renowned for asking regressive
    questions and pigeonholing people in the guise of finding an appropriate
    partner. This approach does not work for millennials and is especially
    derogatory for women who are shamed for having any personality. The
    alternative- dating apps, also don't work for Muslims who are seeking
    marriage and not hookups.

    <br /><br />

    Laddu aims to take online-dating offline and in doing so, create a
    progressive space for marriage-minded Muslims to meet. Our app enables
    Muslims globally to connect in person and offline through tailored events.
    The app is currently being alpha tested, but event registration is open for
    Lahore.

intro:
  heading: How is Laddu different from traditional matchmakers?
  text: >-
    For starters, we are the antidote to misogynistic Rishta aunties who ask
    regressive questions and shame both men and women into domestication with a
    mismatched suitor.

    <br /><br />

    Unlike traditional matchmaking firms, we are a transparent company and have
    no gimmicks. We do not solicit outrageous sums of money on pretentious
    claims, we do not have scary contracts and most importantly we create a safe
    space for our clients to meet several suitable suitors in a short time span.

    <br /><br />

    You will not have to entertain people in your drawing room and endure an
    additional cost of hosting, and then suffer the humiliation of waiting
    endlessly. Our process returns power to our clients, is efficient, and is
    far less expensive way than traditional matchmaking.

      Finding the right partner is a numbers game. Youâ€™ll encounter many frogs
      before you meet your perfect fit. Laddu events facilitate you to meet a
      large number of suitors in a short period of time.

      We find rishta meet-ups where women have to awkwardly serve tea archaic
      and dehumanizing. Allow us to serve the tea, you ask the pertinent
      questions.

      Imagine hosting numerous dinners for multiple rishtas, and potentially not
      liking a single one of them. The whole ordeal can be utterly exhausting,
      especially for women who traditionally host the men. Our events take away
      the pressure of hosting and allow you to connect you with potential
      partners in a more time-efficient and dignified manner.

      suitor likes you.
